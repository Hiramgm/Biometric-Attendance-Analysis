# Biometric-Attendance-Analysis


In this report, the analysis focuses on examining a large dataset collected by a biometric attendance system. The dataset comprises Userid, Check-IN, and Check-OUT details (date and time), and department. The study's objective is to assess the attendance patterns and the dedication of faculty members to their duties. The aim is to demonstrate any potential relationships among these columns.

To commence, potential relationships among the variables Checktime, Checktime2, Check type, and user id have been explored. The primary interest lies in identifying the most regular or punctual employee. Given that the data is in time series format, it was necessary to convert Checktime and Checktime2 to the datetime format. Additionally, the analysis includes an assessment of the number of days a faculty member checked in and whether their check-in times were on schedule.

This research is founded on several assumptions, including the assumption that regular faculty members are also punctual.

The report addresses the following questions:

1: What is the overall attendance pattern of the faculty members?

2: Who is the most regular user?

3: Who is the most punctual user?

4: Can we determine the number of days a faculty member did not sign in?

5: Is it feasible to categorize the days when faculty members did not sign in?
